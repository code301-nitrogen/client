#### Project Pitch
We want to create an educational app that allows uers to access NASA's Mars Rover Program photos API, allowing users to save their favorite images to be returned from a database. The app will also have an educational page with a timeline for the program.

#### Domain Model

###### Model
Our objects are the Images that will be returned from the NASA API. These will have the properties of Rover (which one), Cameras (which one), Dates, Image_Url. We'll have methods to filter based on the properties, fetchAll, loadAll, fetch by user, append to html.

Other methods: We'll need methods to save images to the database (based on a username). 

Our filters include methods to show/hide (for each choice) and to submit.

                <div class="faq">
                    <p id="question">How long is one Mars year?</p>
                    <p id="answer">A Mars DAY is called a sol.  One Mars sol is 24 hrs, 39 min and 35.244 seconds.  One Mars YEAR is 687 Earth days or 1.9 Earth years.</p>
                    <p id="question">What is the temperature on Mars?</p>
                    <p id="answer">The surface temperature of Mars is -153 to 20 degrees Celsius</p>
                    <p id="question">Does Mars have a moon?</p>
                    <p id="answer">Earth has one moon, but Mars has two.  Their names are Phobos and Deimos.</p>
                    <p id="question">Does Mars have mountains?</p>
                    <p id="answer">Yes!  Mars is the home of the tallest mountain in the Solar System, Olympus Mons.</p>
                    <p id="question">When was Mars first discovered?</p>
                    <p id="answer">Mars was first discovered by Egyptian astronomers in 2nd millineum BC.  (Between 2000BC  and 1001 BC).</p>
                    <p id="question">How many missions have there been to Mars?</p>
                    <p id="answer">There have been over 40 missions to Mars.  Only 18 have been successful.</p>
                    <p id="question">What's something that is unique about the Mars rover?</p>
                    <p id="answer">Lasers! On top of Curiosity’s “neck and head” is the ChemCam, which contains a laser capable of vaporizing items found on the Martian landscape — like rocks, soil, solids (or Martians) — from a distance of up to 23 feet. The vaporized substance is then analyzed to see if it is worth further study. ChemCam will help NASA “characterize” the geology of Mars, check for evidence of past habitability, assess the “biological potential” of parts of Mars, and determine whether or not the soil of Mars is toxic to Earthlings.</p>
                    <p id="question">Is the Mars rover as fast as a jet?</p>
                    <p id="answer">Nooooooo. Curiosity will have an average speed of between 0.00018 mph and 0.00073 mph. (1 1/2 to 6 miles a YEAR.) Even on a long day, Curiosity will only travel about 600 ft.</p>
                    <p id="question">Is Curiosity powerful?</p>
                    <p id="answer">Yes and no. The iPhone in your pocket has at least 4 times the computing power of Curiosity, which packs a mere 200MHz CPU, to iPhones 800MHz CPU. Further, Curiosity packs just 256MB of RAM, and 2GB of on-board storage space. The iPhone has 512MB of RAM and up to 64GB of storage. However, Curiosity has multiple computers in case one breaks, all of which are capable of withstanding massive amounts of radiation an iPhone would not survive.</p>
                    <p id="question">"How did Curiosity get to Mars in the first place?"></p>
                    <p id="question">Curiosity has a rough journey to get to Mars and there is no guarantee it will arrive.  Below is a video of it's hard journey to Mars.</p>

                    <p id="question">Does Curiosity have a birthday?</p>
                    <p id="answer">Yes. Its birthday is on August 5, 2012.  For it's 1st Birthday, it sang itself a lonely birthday song.  Millions of Earthlings were sad Curiosity was all alone.  However, Curiosity runs on a nuclear battery that turns heat into electricity and it will eventually die.  In the scientific world, there is no value in songs, so it's vibration unit has been reprogrammed for scientific data collection.  If you would like to hear it sing Happy Birthday, watch the video below.</p>

                <p id="bio">I love getting away from the city and into nature with my camera.  It's not as easy these days while learning to code and juggle a family, but my supportive, beautiful wife and two amazing children make it very worthwhile. </p>

                <h2>Liz Petersen</h2>
                <p id="bio">When I was 11, I wanted to be an astronaut. That dream quickly changed with the onset of the teen years and a driver’s license. A graphic and web designer by training, I am currently studying software development at Alchemy Code Lab in Portland, OR. Hobbies include riding my motorcycle to beautiful places, nature photography, hiking, and camping. I'm a plant nerd, parent of one, and practitioner of mindful communication. The farthest reaches of space have continued to hold my interest, and I have been totally excited working on this project.</p>

                <h2>Katlyn Tucker</h2>
                <p id="bio">I enjoy warping time and space while learning to speak in code. Although not an astronaut, I watched two space shuttle launches and spent many childhood hours at Nasa. I almost applied to the program to colonize Mars,but leaving behind my two teens, friends and family behind and never returning to Earth was a dealbreaker.  In my free time, I take photos, make jewelry and hang out with my kids, where we often sit and watch the Universe.</p>
